# Dioxus File Explorer Integrated with a Terminal Emulator

This project aims to replicate the standard functionality of a file explorer, remade in rust, whilst also providing custom utilities to enhance workflow.

An example is the integrated terminal emulator which is fully synced with the file explorer to show live updates and commands.

In the future, an AI will be implemented to further enhance and interpret workflow from the terminal, allowing for quick and easy directory modifications.

### Notes

Run this to start the app

```bash
dx serve
```

To run for a different platform (which is untested and not sure what will happen), use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
